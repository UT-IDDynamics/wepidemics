From the paper: 

> "For many infectious disease processes such as emerging zoonoses and vaccine-preventable diseases, 0\<R0\<1 and infections occur as self-limited stuttering transmission chains. Utilizing branching process theory along with a negative binomial offspring distribution, we demonstrate how maximum likelihood estimation can be applied to chain size data to infer both R0 and the dispersion parameter that characterizes heterogeneity."
