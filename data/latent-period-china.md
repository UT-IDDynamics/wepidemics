From the abstract: 

> Using detailed exposure information on COVID-19 cases, we estimated the mean latent period to be 5.5 (95% CI: 5.1–5.9) days, shorter than the mean incubation period (6.9 days). Laboratory testing may allow shorter quarantines since 95% of COVID-19 cases shed virus within 10.6 (95% CI: 9.6–11.6) days of infection.
