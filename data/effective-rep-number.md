From the paper: "The effective reproductive number Rt is a key epidemic parameter used to assess whether an epidemic is growing, shrinking, or holding steady. Rt estimates can be used as a near-real-time indicator of epidemic growth or to assess the effectiveness of interventions. But due to delays between infection and case observation, estimating Rt in near-real-time, and correctly inferring the timing of changes in Rt, is challenging. Here, we provide an overview of challenges and best practices for accurate and timely Rt estimation."
