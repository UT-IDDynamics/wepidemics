## Estimates of the risk of large or long-lasting outbreaks of Middle East respiratory syndrome after importations outside the Arabian Peninsula

From the paper:

> “Recent studies have quantified the variability implied by different
> data sets of MERS cluster sizes resulting from importation of cases.
> These studies quantified transmission probabilities using a negative
> binomial offspring distribution within a branching process outbreak
> model, assuming that every infected individual transmits with an
> average of R0 transmissions and dispersion parameter k. In this paper,
> we extend the results of the above work to allow the reproductive
> number R to vary across subsequent generations of transmissions during
> an outbreak \[and derive\] the joint probability of a cluster of total
> size j consisting of exactly g generations of transmission.”

## Accurate estimation of influenza epidemics using Google search data via ARGO

From the abstract: \> Accurate real-time tracking of influenza outbreaks
helps public health officials make timely and meaningful decisions that
could save lives. We propose an influenza tracking model, ARGO
(AutoRegression with GOogle search data), that uses publicly available
online search data. In addition to having a rigorous statistical
foundation, ARGO outperforms all previously available
Google-search–based tracking models, including the latest version of
Google Flu Trends, even though it uses only low-quality search data as
input from publicly available Google Trends and Google Correlate
websites. ARGO not only incorporates the seasonality in influenza
epidemics but also captures changes in people’s online search behavior
over time. ARGO is also flexible, self-correcting, robust, and scalable,
making it a potentially powerful tool that can be used for real-time
tracking of other social events at multiple temporal and spatial
resolutions.

## Estimating the overdispersion in COVID-19 transmission using outbreak sizes outside China

From the paper:

> “We quantified individual-level variation in COVID-19 transmission by
> applying a mathematical model to observed outbreak sizes in affected
> countries. If the observed case counts are part of an ongoing outbreak
> in a country, cluster sizes may grow in the future. To address this
> issue, we adjusted the likelihood for those countries with ongoing
> outbreak by only using the condition that the final cluster size of
> such a country has to be larger than the currently observed number of
> cases.”

## Practical considerations for measuring the effective reproductive number, Rt

From the paper: “The effective reproductive number Rt is a key epidemic
parameter used to assess whether an epidemic is growing, shrinking, or
holding steady. Rt estimates can be used as a near-real-time indicator
of epidemic growth or to assess the effectiveness of interventions. But
due to delays between infection and case observation, estimating Rt in
near-real-time, and correctly inferring the timing of changes in Rt, is
challenging. Here, we provide an overview of challenges and best
practices for accurate and timely Rt estimation.”

## EpiModel: An R Package for Mathematical Modeling of Infectious Disease over Networks

From the abstract:

> Package EpiModel provides tools for building, simulating, and
> analyzing mathematical models for the population dynamics of
> infectious disease transmission in R. Several classes of models are
> included, but the unique contribution of this software package is a
> general stochastic framework for modeling the spread of epidemics on
> networks. EpiModel integrates recent advances in statistical methods
> for network analysis (temporal exponential random graph models) that
> allow the epidemic modeling to be grounded in empirical data on
> contacts that can spread infection. This article provides an overview
> of both the modeling tools built into EpiModel, designed to facilitate
> learning for students new to modeling, and the application programming
> interface for extending package EpiModel, designed to facilitate the
> exploration of novel research questions for advanced modelers.

## Estimating the relative probability of direct transmission between infectious disease patients

From the abstract: \> **Background**: Estimating infectious disease
parameters such as the serial interval (time between symptom onset in
primary and secondary cases) and reproductive number (average number of
secondary cases produced by a primary case) are important in
understanding infectious disease dynamics. Many estimation methods
require linking cases by direct transmission, a difficult task for most
diseases. \> \> **Methods**: Using a subset of cases with detailed
genetic and/or contact investigation data to develop a training set of
probable transmission events, we build a model to estimate the relative
transmission probability for all case-pairs from demographic, spatial
and clinical data. Our method is based on naive Bayes, a machine
learning classification algorithm which uses the observed frequencies in
the training dataset to estimate the probability that a pair is linked
given a set of covariates. \> \> **Results**: In simulations, we find
that the probabilities estimated using genetic distance between cases to
define training transmission events are able to distinguish between
truly linked and unlinked pairs with high accuracy (area under the
receiver operating curve value of 95%). Additionally, only a subset of
the cases, 10–50% depending on sample size, need to have detailed
genetic data for our method to perform well. We show how these
probabilities can be used to estimate the average effective reproductive
number and apply our method to a tuberculosis outbreak in Hamburg,
Germany.

## Bayesian Reconstruction of Disease Outbreaks by Combining Epidemiologic and Genomic Data

From the paper:

> Understanding how infectious diseases are transmitted from one
> individual to another is essential for designing containment
> strategies and epidemic prevention. Recently, the reconstruction of
> transmission trees (“who infected whom”) has been revolutionized by
> the availability of pathogen genome sequences. Exploiting this
> information remains a challenge, however, with a variety of heuristic
> approaches having been explored to date. Here, we introduce a new
> method which uses both pathogen DNA and collection dates to gain
> insights into transmission events, and detect unobserved cases and
> separate introductions of the disease. Our approach is also useful for
> identifying super-spreaders, i.e., cases which caused many subsequent
> infections. After testing our method using simulations, we use it to
> gain new insights into the beginning of the 2003 Singaporean outbreak
> of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). Our approach is
> applicable to a wide range of diseases and available in a free
> software package called outbreaker.

## Maximum Likelihood Estimation of the Negative Binomial Dispersion Parameter for Highly Overdispersed Data, with Applications to Infectious Diseases

> “The negative binomial distribution is used commonly throughout
> biology as a model for overdispersed count data, with attention
> focused on the negative binomial dispersion parameter, k. This article
> presents a simulation study exploring the bias, precision, and
> confidence interval coverage of maximum-likelihood estimates of k from
> highly overdispersed distributions.”

## Inference of R0 and Transmission Heterogeneity from the Size Distribution of Stuttering Chains

From the paper:

> “For many infectious disease processes such as emerging zoonoses and
> vaccine-preventable diseases, 0\<R0\<1 and infections occur as
> self-limited stuttering transmission chains. Utilizing branching
> process theory along with a negative binomial offspring distribution,
> we demonstrate how maximum likelihood estimation can be applied to
> chain size data to infer both R0 and the dispersion parameter that
> characterizes heterogeneity.”

## Superspreading and the effect of individual variation on disease emergence

From the paper:

> Here we present an integrated theoretical and statistical analysis of
> the influence of individual variation in infectiousness on disease
> emergence. Using contact tracing data from eight directly transmitted
> diseases, we show that the distribution of individual infectiousness
> around R0 is often highly skewed. Model predictions accounting for
> this variation differ sharply from average-based approaches, with
> disease extinction more likely and outbreaks rarer but more
> explosive."

## High variability in transmission of SARS-CoV-2 within households and implications for control

From the paper:

> “In this study, we combine SARS-CoV-2 data from serological antibody
> tests and self-reported prior tests to estimate within-household
> transmission of COVID-19 in Utah. Previously published secondary
> attack rate estimates are largely based on crude formulae which ignore
> the probabilities of multiple members of a household acquiring
> infection from the community, multiple generations of transmission
> within the household (i.e. secondary, tertiary, etc. transmissions),
> and imperfect test sensitivity and specificity. We addressed these
> limitations by extending previous models of final household outbreak
> size distributions to develop a novel probabilistic model of household
> importation and household transmission combined with test sensitivity
> and specificity. Our model also quantifies variability in household
> transmission and the potential extent of overdispersion.”
