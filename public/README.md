## Practical considerations for measuring the effective reproductive number, Rt

From the paper: “The effective reproductive number Rt is a key epidemic
parameter used to assess whether an epidemic is growing, shrinking, or
holding steady. Rt estimates can be used as a near-real-time indicator
of epidemic growth or to assess the effectiveness of interventions. But
due to delays between infection and case observation, estimating Rt in
near-real-time, and correctly inferring the timing of changes in Rt, is
challenging. Here, we provide an overview of challenges and best
practices for accurate and timely Rt estimation.”

## A Flexible and General Agent-Based Model Engine

Epiworld is a C++ template library that implements a flexible ABM
building framework. It can be used for estimating parameters, forward
simulation, and policy evaluation. The C++ library is also implemented
in R.
