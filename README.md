# A Wiki on Epidemic Modeling

- Transmissibility and efficiency of various transmission mechanisms ([link](#Transmissibility-and-efficiency-of-various-transmission-mechanisms))
- Severity, stratified by key demographics
- Immune escape (from immunity generated by prior infection)
- Vaccine effectiveness and duration of effectiveness
- Diagnostic sensitivity for active (acute) infection
- Viral kinetics/epidemiological parameters (e.g., incubation period, latent period)
- Treatment escape
- Risk factors for infection and severity
- Importation risk
- Population mobility
- Population level immunity (natural and vaccine derived)
- Other co-circulating pathogens of concern (i.e., if during a significant influenza season)
- Resource / healthcare system capacity
