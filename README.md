# wepidemics: A Wiki for Epidemic Modeling

This repository compiles information about epidemics modeling. The goal is
to provide a centralized and standardized way of adding annotated data entries
about methods, software, data, and scientific articles on the subject. 

The main entries are located in the [`data`](data) folder. The [`docs`](docs) folder
contains reports made using that data. The site can be compiled using `make all`
in the docs folder.
